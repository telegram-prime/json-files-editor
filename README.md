## Features:
1. Parameter Modification
  - Allows the user to specify a parameter (key) in JSON files that needs to be modified or added.
  - Users can provide a value for the parameter, and the script will either update the existing key or add it if it does not exist in the JSON file.
  - Users can use a dropdown list of pre-defined parameters or manually input their own parameter key.
  - String Conversion Option: Provides an option to always treat the parameter value as a string, regardless of its original data type.
2. Spintax Support
  - Supports spintax syntax (e.g., {123|456}) for random selection among multiple possible values.
  - Automatically processes spintax to generate randomized values for the parameter.
3. Dynamic Parameter Value from Filename
  - Users can set the parameter value based on the JSON file's name.
  - This can be helpful in situations where the file name is meaningful (e.g., setting a parameter like "phone" to match the file name).
4. Delete Parameter
  - Provides an option to delete a specified parameter from all JSON files.
  - This can be useful for removing unnecessary or outdated keys from all files in bulk.
5. Dedicated Folder for Edited Files
  - Users can specify that edited files should be saved in a dedicated output folder rather than overwriting the original files.
  - Creates a timestamped folder to store the edited versions of the JSON files for easy differentiation from the originals.
6. Corresponding .session File Handling
  - The script automatically checks if a corresponding .session file (with the same base name as the .json file) exists in the source folder.
  - If a matching .session file is found, it will be copied to the destination folder along with the edited .json file, preserving the session file association.
7. Backup Functionality
  - Provides an option to create a backup of the original folder before modifications.
  - The backup is stored in a separate timestamped folder located next to the original folder, ensuring easy recovery if needed.
8. GUI Status Updates
  - The "Update JSON Files" button dynamically updates its label and color based on the script's status (e.g., "Working", "Done") to inform the user of ongoing processes.
  - Provides progress notifications and warnings, such as reaching the operation limit or successful backup creation.
9. Error Handling and Notifications
  - Integrated error handling with detailed messages to notify the user of any issues during the modification process.
  - Uses message popups to inform users about the status of operations, such as backups, JSON edits, or license issues.
10. Updates & Support
  - Free updates to further version are included.
  - Free online support from team.
